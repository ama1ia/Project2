			<div class="box a"><b>Who am I?</b>
				<br>My name is Amalia Perez. I am an animal activist that 
					thinks that animals should not be caged up and 
					allowed to be free in the wild.

			<div class="box b"><b>What am I doing?</b>
				<br>I am rebelling against having wild animals as 
					pets.
			</div>
			
			<div class="box c"><b>Why am I rebelling?</b>
				<br>I am rebelling because these animals not only pose a threat to humans, but humans also pose a threat to animals. Wild animals are meant to stay in the wild where they have enough space and freedom to do whatever they want.
