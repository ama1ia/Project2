				<div class="box b">Most wild animals carry diseases that are fatal for human beings. These are also known as zoonotic diseases. Some of these diseases include:<br> 
					<ol>
						<li>Salmonella (from reptiles/amphibians)</li>
						<li>Monkey Pox (from Gambian Rats)</li>
					</ol></div>
				<div class="box c">Animals also become more unpredictable as they get older.</div>
				<div class="box d">Without the proper training, it is dangerous for a person to take care of a wild animal.</div>
				<div class="box e">It takes centuries for an animal to be considered domestic. A wild animal will always be wild unless it is domesticated over centuries.</div>
